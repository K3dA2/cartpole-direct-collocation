# Cartpole Swing-up Solver
This repository contains an implementation of the direct trapezoidal collocation method in Python to solve the cartpole swing-up problem. The cartpole swing-up problem is a classic control problem in which a cart must balance an inverted pendulum (the pole) by applying appropriate forces. The goal is to swing the pole from its stable downward position to an upward position while maintaining balance.

 - Implementation in Python using numerical optimization techniques

**Dependencies**

The following dependencies are required to run the cartpole swing-up solver:
- Python 
- NumPy
